Application Logging
===================

***Logging***
 * Log all information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe. [CWE-223](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/223.html)  
 * Log all authentication activities [CWE-778](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)  
 * Log all elevated-rights activity [CWE-778](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)  
 * Log all elevated-rights changes [CWE-778](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)  
 * Log administrative activities [CWE-778](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)  
 * Log all access to sensitive data [CWE-778](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)  
 * Log only data that meets your risk tolerance [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)  
 * Log only enough to support application debugging, as well as recovery efforts or forensic analysis after an attack [CWE-779](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/779.html)  
 * Do not write secrets into the log files [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)  
 * When sensitive or critical information are required, encrypt them before logging [CWE-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)  
 * Logs are sensitive, protect them [CWE-533](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/533.html)  
 * Set log levels appropriately before promoting or shipping a product so that sensitive data and system information are not accidentally exposed to hostile agents. [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)  
 * Protect log files against unauthorized read/write. [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)  
 * Log only "safe" data {logs are an attack path, neutralize hostile content} [CWE-117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)  
 * All error message text should be HTML entity encoded before being written to the log file to protect against potential cross-site scripting attacks against the viewer of the logs {logs are an attack path, neutralize hostile content} [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html) 
 * Log only "known good" input.  Assume all input is malicious. Use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


***Error Handling***
 * Display generic, non-descriptive error messages [CWE-209]()  
 * Never emit unhandled errors [CWE-391]()  
 * Configure an 'error-handler of last resort' [CWE-391]()  
 * Suppress raw framework-generated errors [CWE-209]()  
 * [CWE-]()  
 * [CWE-]()  
 * []()  
 * []()
